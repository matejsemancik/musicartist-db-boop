# musicartist-db-boop
School project app for music artist database written in .NET C#

Beware, there might be some comments in the code, you might not understand. It's in Slovak.
Project can be opened in Visual Studio by opening the project file.
I also included sample database file 'Databaza.csv' that you can import in the app.
